  <h1>POETRY</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>she has been cast as the Inevitable Blooming Onion.<br>
she makes her entrance.<br> 
lights up, center stage right.<br>
a single spotlight<br> 
‘here i am!’<br>
 blooming onion: inevitable unravel, she precedes with an audience<br>
having no eyes<br> 
they are left only to open their mouths<br>
i sit on my hands, mouth open watching her<br> 
i am now clogging my mouth with paper, the same paper they handed everyone else<br>
there is more than one drop of accompanied blood<br> 
this little girl inside me :  thats where she lives, wonders why, in constant<br>
now the shows over<br> 
she takes my hands out of my mouth, telling me how beautiful i am.<br> 
“i feel beautiful” i tell her<br> 
but then she asks why?<br>
does she even need to know why?<br> 
taking my bow at the smallest of applause<br>
i am met with the same little girl, only she has a razor blade in her hand<br>
this time she has stepped outside of me<br>
this girl has given me one motion,<br>
this little girl still stabbing me with metal corners<br> 
my scales are broken exposing my fleshy insides,<br> 
i am in the constant ask of why.<br> 

      
    </p>









    
    <p>if she was to start again,<br>

as she’s doing now,<br>

her ankles would fall through the<br>

ground,<br>

planted she is no longer expelling upwards,<br>

towards Bethlehem,<br>

fresh<br>

the pair of lungs digest the old burning<br>

she breathes again<br>

giving birth<br>

to the nameless</p>
