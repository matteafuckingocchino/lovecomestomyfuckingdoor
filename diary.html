  <p> i want to be in love. i deleted tumblr. im gonna take a break for at least a week. i want to loose 115 pounds. i need to stop looking at people through my phone. take photos for me, for mwah. 12:56pm.</p>
  <p> nathan bagel sanwhich n a matcha (400) 12:22pm </p>
  <p> karlie and i changed the trash, and i watched her eat an enchilldia (spelled it wrong). im about to make a sandwhich and not feel guilty about it. i wrote a poem that i don't feel good about. 12:09pm.</p>
  <p> i am work right now. everything is okay. im debating if i should pickup after work. Enya just offically quite today and i got asked to pickup two shifts, but I work on Sundays at my other job so I just have to calm down and figure this out. I still haven't seen Andrew, but there is a part of me that thinks he'll be here by 11am. 10:29am </p>
  <p> okay i say Andrew!!!! hes very cold he says, but indeed wearing a t-shirt in 20 degree weather. im happy i got to see him. 10:38am
  <p>January 29, 2026</p>
  <p>im starting the fuck over</p>
  <p> i just woke up and i am going to try and write to you on here. i don't want to forget anything, as i have forget so much. my Dad told me this morning “hope isn’t any good without action.”6:10am.</p>                                                                           </p> O, most beautiful flower of Mount Carmel,

    
Fruit of the Vine, splendorous of Heaven.
Blessed Mother of the Son of God,
Immaculate Virgin,
assist me in this my necessity.
O, Star of the Sea, help me
and show herein you are my mother.
O, Holy Mary, Mother of God, Queen of Heaven and earth,
I humbly beseech you from the bottom of my heart
to succour me in my necessity.
There are none that can withstand your power,
O, show me here you are my mother.
O, Mary, conceived without sin,
pray for us who have recourse to Thee.
Sweet Mother, I place this cause in your hands.
Amen.</p>
<p>i am going to have a good day; or i am determinded to make it a great day. i give my worries 2 god and i trust in them. i pray to my ancestors to help me; im desperate. 6:31am</p>
<p>im at work right now and i want to make this more than quick!!!! mainly because i want jason to see me working hard when he comes in today. i want to date another transexual. 10:24am</p>
  <p>no jason; he still hasn’t come in yet, and i honestly wonder if he’ll be in today. i can’t stop thinking of beautiful transexual with beautiful tattoos. i don’t know if i want to be her or be With her. maybe both. if she likes me, then i am likable! i find myself wanting this beautiful stranger - to tell me im doing good, if she says it than it is bound to be true. 11am</p>
  <p>still no Jason. I really wonder if he will be in later, but I highly doubt he’ll see me today. I miss him. I want the February schedule to come out already so I can have the peace of mind that my hours aren’t getting cut, even though I already know that they are not going to get cut I was reading earlier, but I can’t concentrate in this environment. It is too loud. I need to start acting like a bad bitch; stop worrying and actually get more done for my future. I need to start looking at nursing schools. My mother will be very proud of me. I will follow in her footsteps. 11:51am</p>
  <p>I am a bad bitch. I am sexy, beautiful I am intriguing. My femininity grows more and more every day just like my beauty. I’m grateful for my big green eyes. I I am someone because I am my mother‘s daughter.12:41pm</p>
  <p>A few people have come in to look around; no one has bought anything, however. I don’t think I’ll be seeing jason at all today. I’m trying to think of what else I can do in the meantime? I rescheduled my labs, my folks appointment, and I still have to email my counselor. I want to be in love so bad. I honestly have no idea how to “fall “in love I do know, however I need to find the love inside myself, let that shine and be enough. Is it bad to be a 24 year-old who’s never been in a serious relationship? I feel like such an outsider, my only true love, my one true love, has been my mother.2:00</p>
  <p>OK, so I did indeed see jason today, and it made my whole week. My brain has been trying to convince me that somehow he’s upset with me. But him, seeing him reassured me that he is indeed likes me. I’m trying not to panic over the snow this weekend as JASON told me that the shop might be closed. It only worries me because I’ve had three shifts canceled because of snow and that’s $312. I’m trying not to worry about money because money really does love me as much as I love it. in a Constance I must remember I am in a constant state of receiving.4:27pm</p>
