  i did indeed just have a breakdown at work. i dont necessarily understand what triggered it. i hate that word, triggered. i dont nessarily know why i was feelin so bad, other than i have been tricked in2 my own mind. its like someone has placed a curse on2 my brain. it is hard somedays 2 understand that i dont need 2 interalize all of my thoughts, especially the thoughts that arn’t true. i say this objectively, but i am indeed insecure as i allow so much 2 penetrate through in2 feeling. im telling myself that i need 2 b stronger. im telling myself that i need 2 knock it the fuck off. im telling myself 2 keep fucking going. 2:01pm 2/20 </br>
</br>

i love sensitive souls. the world needs s much more sensitivity. 1:44pm 02/20 </br>
</br>
i think it was really naive for me 2 give so much of myself. and maybe thats why i feel like a snot rag. i need 2 grow up. and i need 2 reserve myself, especially as i start new in Jersey. this move in Ellijay was needed much more than i thought. 1:04pm 02/20</br>
</br> 
oh i absolutely feel like going 2 go fuck myself 2 be a fucking clown. fucking fuck fuck. motherfucking fucking fuck. why don’t i feel special? i feel like a ball of absolute trash. i feel so unworthy. so unloveable. i knoe this isn’t true, i know it!!! but why is my brain trying 2 play tricks on me. im too bad for this shit. maybe ill give up on love from someone else. maybe ill just retreat more in2 myself. maybe ill still yearn. but i feel as if my love is best practioned through motherhood. i must become bad for myself. i must not feel every thought that passes through my head. 12:50pm 02/20 </br> 
</br>
so i think ryan was just talking 2 me because he was indeed bored. im not special. maybe i am. i wont investigate. my head hurts. like a feel fuzzy in my head no matter the amount of water injected in2 my body. maybe i need 2 go get something 2 eat? maybe? 12:40pm 02/20</br>
</br>
i need 2 reread the Illyad and Confusion and all my greek plays and just get my fucking shit togther. young man knows more than me, so i must catch up. 12:12pm 02/20 </br>
</br>
young girl asks book boyfriend 2 take pictures in book store. Yuck. Ryan has been talking 2 me all morning, which has been very easy and nice. he is a nice person 2 talk 2 as i can say anything or respond in any type of way n i feel as if it will be enough 4 him. im in the eternal debate if i should pick up weed 2nite. i most likely shouldn’t no i shouldn’t. i should save my money. its rotting my brain. i need 2 b able 2 communicate unadored. but i crave the escape, genuinely. but after talking 2 Ryan i dont wanna be an air head. i dont want 2 present myself with my head empty. im craving a cigarette. 11:20am 02/20 </br>
</br>
i just found out my aunt carol has passed away after a long battle of cancer. this feels heavy. i didn’t know her personally as much as my father (his sister, his best friend) but i texted Renee. my heart breaks for all the heart breaks. death is hard. death is uncomfortable. death is inevitable. after loosing my mom, death from someone doesn’t seem 2 touch or penetrate through to me. death feels almost impersonal here in America. has hustle culture ruined the way we grieve. i believe in the pause. i believe in the acknowledgment. i believe in hoping off the wheel. you have two weeks 2 get back 2 ‘normal’ or you’ll get fired. there is no such thing as taking time 2 process when you are so focused on the future. is death a reminder? why is there so much death in this part of my life. Mom, Aunt Nancy, Uncle Mike, Cousin Tony, Cousin Adam and now Aunt Carol. all in the span of 3 fucking years. 7:47am 02/20 </br>
</br>
i wanna sleep next 2 someoneeeeeeee.ill close my eyes 2nite and become 5 years old again. ill pretend i had a nightmare and im sleeping with mom.  9:30pm 02/20</br>
</br>
i miss my mother. 9:09pm 02/20 </br>
</br>
i look forward 2 my progesterone every nite. if i ever get a doctor who shows me fear (my mind is stuck on this on doctor from long ago) doctors need empathy. i didn’t do pilates but did do a 5 min plank. i’ll go 2wice 2morrow. 8:55pm</br>
</br>
if i keep thinking im ugly im gonna turn ugly!! stop mattea!!! trust your beauty!!! stop feeeing in2 the insecurity!!! 8:55pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
i wonder if any hearts have been broken in my wake of absences. 7:21pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
i think they asked john 2 cover a shift instead of me. that mite b because i have 2 jobs and they r trying 2 b respectful. i also leave soon so i must not worry Mattea. 5:51pm 02/19 </br>
</br> 
Love Telling You 2 Go Eat Shit!!!!!!! 5:30pm 02/19 </br>
</br> 
maybe i’ll go vegan again. 5:29pm 02/19 </br>
</br> 
i miss my mom. i miss my mom so much. 5:28pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
methinks ill take a macbook photoshoot when i get home, methinks. i had a cup of coffee and im not hungry but i do feel alittle weak. so i will get a sandwich maybe. its bad im overthinking this 2day. i can’t wait 4 therapy. scott made it in, and that has put me in a really good mood. maybe ill get pizza. 5:17pm 02/19 </br>

</br>
8th Grade Girl said She Likes My Hair I AM UNSTOPABLE 3:55pm 02/19 </br>
honestly and wholeheartedly i Am Not starving myself 4 three days. reading this all back makes me really want 2 delete it. but im not going 2. im going 2 change my course of action moving forward. after work ill go 2 the italian place next door, or maybe ill go @ 5 if it isnt busy at all. i dont want 2 b turning 25 with issues that ive dealt with since i was 16. i feel pathetic at how natural it comes but i can’t get 2 upset as i have enouf awareness over myself 2 stop these bad habits and 4 that i must b proud of myself. 3:51pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
jason just asked if i brought food. i said yes even though i didn’t. if i said no maybe he would’ve made me gumbo. maybe…im being greedy. 3:29pm 02/19</br>
</br>
it is very dead, and Jason is still here. which means i can’t leave and get a blueberry muffin. which honestly is good because i need 2 fast. i think about religious fasting, like Saint Rose Of Lima. im just talking 2 u. i unpacked boxed, and put vinyls away. now, i just wait for another 2 hours and 45 mins. i wonder what else the day will bring me. next week i have blood work. next wesnesday, and then the following monday i have an appointment with my endro. i’m trying 2 not have any fear or anxiety as this is all good things. 3:28pm 02/19</br>
</br> 
i am beautiful. i am a beautiful girl, even when my mind thinks im not. i will always be a beautiful girl. i love my face. i love my big green eyes and thick eyebrows. i love having a nose with a bump. i love myself. i love my face i have the face of my mother. 3:12pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
matt just came in2 the store, with tears in his eyes. this is where i am not the best with words. i just gave him a really big hug. 2:32pm 02/19 </br>
</br>
i trust that My Beauty Shines Through. 11:47am 02/19</br>
</br>
hi my names Mattea and i need 2 get serious and by serious i need 2 do some action. i will start my tea test prep 2morrow. 11:45am 02/19 </br>
</br> 
i love jason. i dont deserve jason as a boss. he is the sweetest purest soul. he has built such an amazing life; from my eyes. i can feel all the love that has been poured in2 him. i wonder if i will c scott later. 11:44am 02/19 </br>
</br> 

no tea but i miss the city at this time. however, whenever i saw someone wearing flip flops, or sandals, hell even burkenstocks around the city i would almost force every guest 2 wash his or her feet in the bathtub because wtf the sidewalks smell, and i can’t help but obsess over the fact that some of that street debre (can’t spell) has lodged itself on2 the bottom of your bare feet; rite inbetween your toes. 11:42am 02/19</br>
</br>
okay in a desperate attempt 2 get my shit in order i am inventing my glow up rules; 
<u>no cutting</u></br>
<u>no smoking </u> </br>
<u> no coke </u> </br>
<u> no alcohol </u> </br>
<u> no spending moeny </u></br>
<u> eat no more than 700 cals a day </u></br> 
<u>daily stretches</u></br>
<u> daily pilates </u> </br> 
 </br>
u really can only learn through change. not stagnation. 11:17am 02/19</br>
</br>
well jason has indeed made it in. which why i wonder. i enjoy these moments by myself because i can do my own work, my own thing without the eyes of others. i wonder. i wonder how 2day will b. the parking lot across he street looks quite packed, but no one seems 2 b outside. even yesterday, the day seemed 2 keep people inside. i’m indifferent i feel indifferent. i don’t necessarily crave anything or am in the desire 4 something, which 2 me reaps satisfaction. however, i am anything but satisfied. so what is this feeling? exhaustion? that mite explain my permanent dark circles. maybe jason will tell me 2 leave early? must most likely not. 10:43am 02/19 </br>
</br>
i also think that i need stagnation right now. im upset at the assumption. however i havent lived in the same place for longer than 9 months 4 the past 5 years. death is death is death. my mom died my uncle died my aunt died my two cousins over dosed. all i crave is stagnation. i don’t want anymore unasked, inevitable change. especially through death. 10:22am 02/19 </br>
</br> 
i should actually grow 2 be more grateful 4 this boredom. arthur c brooks says boredom is a gift. too much boredom is bad, not knowing how 2 interact with your boredom can be dangerous. maybe more people need 2 get confrotable with being bored. so many idea comes from being bored. the ability 2 think, the opportunity shines bright when born youtube boredom. IM GRATEFUL 2 BE BORED!!!!!! 10:18am 02/19 </br>
</br> 
i am clocked in at work. all i can think about is being home. i just want to be home. i don’t know if my indifference is because of how boring this job is, howeverr i should be grateful at the opporunity to make money. i am grateful at the opportunity 2 make money. i want 2 asked Pen Pal if he got my letter, but i am anxious of being too much. i think my intecuirty will be my demise if i don’t find security from and inside myself. 10:14am 02/19 </br>
</br>
life is inevitably sad and it has been 4 a while i think now it feels as if it is the acceptance stage. there’s nothing new in the heaviness. even thinking about jersey has me very anxious. i am doubting if i can even do it, inside myself 2 build something worthwhile. 2 make myself lovable. 9:23am 02/19</br>
</br>
maybe remember (remembrance) is the ultimate sure tell sign of love, as you c someone in everything u do? and the remembrance (did i use that right?) is that of self inflicted because soon this world will too get eaten by the sun and 4gotten. 2 remember in a world that is inevitably going 2 b forgotten. 8:34am 02/19 </br>
</br>
when Kh dm me i thought i would feel differently, as i have thought about him from time 2 time. as he is the only man i have really written about. however, i am met with a satisfied disappointment. i’m not the same girl i used 2 b, as i don’t feel as desperate 4 mouths as much as i used 2 b. it must be real enough 2 touch. it must b real enough 2 build something ontop of it. it must be real enough!!!!! 8:03am 02/19 </br>

</br>

i hate being so sensitive. but i also understand the value in my sensitivity. it feels as if my 6 senses are intensified. i feel deeply. i take my feelings with me, they are mine. do people need 2 become less sensitive or do people need 2 become more sensitive? sensitivity almost feels like connection. it makes me feel the most human, and maybe thats because there is nothing human about it. or maybe its the most human you can be. to lack sensitivity is 2 resort back in2 the animalistic nature that we once originated from. maybe thats why its so special when a giant gorilla decides to adopt a kitten, treating it preciously. maybe the obsession with that comea from the actualization that that relationship itself is more human than most humans themselves. lack of empathy feels like something prehistoric. where are we 2 go without eachother in thought? as it is inevitable 2 coexist with people with humans more or less sensitive than you. being mature, is being a composed sensitive, rather than an internalized instrument unavailable 2 process any emotion. 02/19 </br>
</br>

currently i am watching bugonia. i would usually watch RHONY but im trying to not rot mybrain. my goal for the next three days is 2 not eat anything. to do daily pilates. i would go on a walk but its raining again. and maybe its different here, different down south. rain usually doesn’t upset me, especially when its cold. however, when its humid the rain feels like walking through 3 feet of water. and not beforework nonetheless. i texted swall this morning and i got a dry response. i wont internalize. but then again, it has me spiraling as i can’t think of anything i have done wrong. but i need 2 stop the investigation, and if there is issue it will be communicated to me. i am so alone. i am the most alone i have ever even felt before. and even when i think about basil and emerson, its not like my hand is held through this dark period. basil will text me have a good week, and i love you but he has yet 2 ask me how im feeling. how i am actually doing. i don’t have the energy 2 extend my own olive branch. i am understanding the usefulness of being selfish as sometimes it is the best antidote to preserve. i wish i was selfish when i was in 6th grade. i wish i was selfish when i was taking voice lessons with miss pamela. maybe the only person 2 see right through me was Fran. i think about Fran; the cadence of her boston accent, her love for dogs. but importantly, the love she has had 4 me. to this very day. 10 years later it still fills me up. 7:12am 02/19</br>
</br>
i would go as far 2 say that tattoos inherently don’t make you cool, especially if everyone has what you have. maybe that’s mean. 6:36am 02/19 </br>

i definitely need him 2 b goofy. we both can’t b pessimistic, or b infatuated with The Color Grey. 6:12am 02/19</br>

</br>

i’m still in bed. penelope is sleeping next me, and she has been since 5am. i’m so cozy i don’t have any motivation 2 move my legs. i must stretch this morning. i must do pilates. i must loose weight n i must work on my body. lmao i love how i just talked about insecurity. 5:05am 02/19</br>
</br>

i am not insecure because i Don’t need 2 put my full stock off worth n happiness in2 the decision of whether im worthy in front of the eyes of a Man through a Fuck Phone or from the lost art of Letter Writing i Won’t Allow insecurity 2 eat at me anymore as i Will Eat At It!! 5:41am 02/19

also not posting my even thought on tumblr has been healthy as i’m not looking 4 anything other than a dump a shoulder an ear when im writing 2 u. 2:04 02/18 </br>
</br> 
whole lotta fuck you. i don’t think i’ll b opening up 2 Hammer anymore. simply because im immature. i’m a child. i want not obsession, no, consistency, no, maybe to feel there is a sense of genuineness from this exchange. but honestly talking only makes me feel like a mess like a victim. am i only talked 2, 2 be touched? i say this only because so much hasn’t been said there are More Things You Don’t Know and i’m upset that you think you know my full feathers just from a picture, an inference. i will never do that 2 no one because i will Never fully understand Anyone. but i never like 2 define anyone Because I Know what it’s like 2 feel defined. Fuck That. But i have been talking 2 Swall and this is the subtle friendship the subtle exchange i need, and it fills me up with so little because it feels genuine. not automated; maybe i am naive. 1:43pm 02/18</br>
</br> 
trevor will just send me random photos of themselves. i get pissed. because i genuinely didn’t mind it at first, but he never asks about me or checks in on me and i Fucking need a shoulder. i don’t wanna dump as well, especially because the last time i tried 2 tell him what has been going on with me, he legitimately told me That He Is Not My Therapist. but i wasn’t asking 4 any advice. i just wanted someone 2 listen 2 me!!!! so i’m gonna keep the ignorance as i don’t have the energy 2 carry anything because i Need To Carey Myself. Should it be this hard? am i an asshole for my distain? i don’t think so but some mite. i’m indifferent. i’m not slitting my wrists anymore ask me about Fuck. 12:31pm 02/18</br>

today was the first morning i didn’t swallow laxatives. i pooped on my own 4 the first time in 2 years. may i keep this streak going, as by the grace of god, i haven’t ruined my bowels. 12:19pm 02/18 </br>
</br> 
i woke up crying. i legit woke up with tears down my face, my heart beating outside of my chest. i dont even know or remember what i was dreaming about. i made it mandatory 4 my father, my best friend, 2 get coffee with me. my sister came along but she complained the whole time. its hard not 2 compare myself 2 where i think i should be but i must check it inside myself 2 remember that comparison is the work of the devil. such beauty and sentimentality should not be under the criticism of comparison, even if you think it is a compliment. 12:16pm 02/18 </br>
</br>
so my phone camera has stopped working. which is a motivator 2 just bring my camera and adaptor with me now, wherever i go. even for selfies. blah. i have black high dye in my hair. and then at the 25 min mark i need 2 dye my eyebrows 2 match. i want 2 look like zoe so bad. i mean we look so similar already, but i say that in the affirmation and admiration of such beauty on such a person. its like looking at a work of absolute perfect creation. im jealous but in the way that doesn’t have any ill or terrible feel to it. im jealous in the sense that i admire what she has, and i too want that 4 myself. ill get there if im not already there. 12:07pm 02/18 </br>

he only followed me 4 my tight ass. yes, that makes me sad but also i must Remember that Too Is Power. 11:33am 02/18</br> 
</br>
i don’t care about the things i shouldn’t and won’t ever care about again. and actually maybe it’s inevitable 2 care, as it is a very human thing 2 do. but i must remember when i do care that these men only wanted one thing from me, and i was so willing 2 give it. i’m not beating myself up anymore, because i know why. i know why that girl did the things that she did. i know where her action was coming from, the motivation behind pleasing. i’m aware enough 2 not make the same mistakes again. i’m aware enough 2 hold myself 2 a different standard. and i’m aware enough 2 understand that it’s only about my own perception of myself, My Head on My Pillow. 11:30am 02/18 </br>

i’ve been reading the same booK for two weeks because i keep rereading the first 5 chapters.

i cant fall asleep. i wont scroll however. i am watching ratatouille. i feel insecure reading back what i have said 2 you, but that is good because it shows me the parts i kinda want to change. like how vulgar i can be. or maybe this could be the space for my vulgarity. im not gonna o. 10:57pm 02/17</br>

jasons back. hes fixing an order that got damaged. theres an hour left until close, so I don't really know if hes gonna be here with me. i am shocked he is still here. maybe this means hes closing with me. i keep thinking about weed. i turned the temp up 2 72, and thats also too hot 4 jason but i don’t try and get mad because he does have diabetes and i wonder if that is the reason why he runs so hot. i love jason. 5:34pm 02/17 </br>

i hate 2 shit so bad and jason isnt back yet and i feel like if i lock the door 2 shit that will b the divine timing of when he gets back. maybe he has gone 4 the day and just his computer bag. i feel annoying. 4:07pm </br>
</br>
there needs 2 be a scientific study that investigates the question of why some people look like they smoke cigarettes and why some do not. 3:39pm 02/17 </br>
</br>
its strange because these bad habits felt almost normalized in the city in that time, it felt like i was doing something that everyone else was doing. but i think the lesson in that is that i indeed need 2 listen 2 myself, and guide myself like a parent. as of the past 3 years, i have followed no croud. and it has been lonely, but maybe its the first time im acknowledging myself without the influence of pleasing others. people pleasures annoy me, simply because they are dishonest. i appreciate honesty, especially if it is uncomfortable. 3:26pm 02/17</br>

after work and you were working, i would visit you. or maybe id cook something, to have someone and something waiting 4 u. if not through your heart then through your stomach. 3:25pm 02/17 </br>

unfortunately i need someone whos gonna fucking spell it out for me. im dumb and deeply insecure at times. 3:24pm 02/17 </br> 
</br>
whats on my mind rite now? nothing. my head is empty and it feels good, but pauses of a dangerous situation. i want to put my headphones in n listen/watch rhony because it eats away time so well, so fucking quick. its past the time jason usually leaves, but i have a feeling he is at the roof or the door because of mari gras. i spelled that wrong, and i am judging myself. 3:23pm 02/17 </br>

ive been listening to keith sweat all fucking day 3:19pm 02/17 </br>
</br>
i wanna go home. jason is somewhere else. i asked my sister 2 bring me food, but then i said no. maybe after work ill go to the store quick, get hair dye and something to make, but honesty i feel like going straight home rite now. ill cook left over noodles or something. i already had two kind bars today and a protein bar. im trying not to eat outve boredom anymore. also being high would cause me 2 binge eat like a motherfucker. all of this will stop. im not hungry right now, so therefore i dont need food. maybe ill go vegan again. i wanna loose 15lbs. 3:10pm 02/17 </br>

okay allow me to romatize alittle bit. because i am feeling giddy at the thought. i am listening to spaghetti western / italian grit music. i feel like being out in the sun. i want to wear a dress tomorrow. im smiling, im smiling as i talk to you. im tempted to by clothes after work, but i wont. maybe i won’t. after work im gonna go 2 walmart and grab hair dye. i feel my roots are beginning to make me insecure. darken my eyebrows too. theres a sense of urgency in this pursuit. so maybe that is an incline 2 not do it; as i do have black eyebrow dye and hair dye at home. im trying to be smarter with my money, especially because i am moving, and i should save my money. maybe ill go to walmart and get indgrediants to make something. maybe this is just me trying to pass time. and think about what i dont have. i have enough. i have enough. i have enough. i dont need anything more. so i will reist the urge, and saving is like spending money but for my future. i just want to feel cute enough, but that is in trusting i am already enough, i have everything i already need. maybe the documentation of my outfits is the proof of my style. 1:38pm 02/17 </br>

uncritical in my movement. i don’t think i would search for validation in my own perception of myself, therefore maybe i would move with much more ease. maybe i would move with less gravity. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what does “secure Mattea” do when she wakes up?</u></i></br>
she doesn’t look at her phone. she doens’t look in the mirror, and she doesn’t write things in2 her arm. before she even leaves the bed she plays a song, closes her eyes and pictures all the things she’s grateful for. she drinks two cups of water before having black coffee. she stretches. she puts on a cleansing movie, or something for the background. she doens’t worry. she sets her intention and prays. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what habits would the grounded version of myself naturally drop?</u></i></br>
smoking weed, binge drinking, cutting my body, internalizing every thought that passes through my mind </br>
</br>
<i><u>what does femininity feel like in my body when im calm?</u></i></br>
i don’t know how to describe it other than the word powerful. it feels like i can breathe underwater. it feels inherit and it feels absolutely effortless. </br>
</br>
<i><u>when do i feel most like myself?</u></i></br>
probably when i am silent and when i am dancing when i am actively loving on someone. mayb when i am in the shower. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what would change if i stopped scanning for “proof” and started living for certainty?</u></i></br>
i probably would feel less exhausted and less like a candle in the wind; my purest self would shine through. so the thing that would change is the energy i put out, going directly back in2 myself. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what are three daily small beghaviors that could compound into a new life in 6 months?</u></i></br>
daily pilates, no smoking, and reading for one hour.</br>
</br>
<i><u>where am i leaking energy</u>?</i></br>
when i worry, when i smoke, when i cut, when i drink, when i have meaningless sex with strangers, when i don’t push through my uncomfortable feelings. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what does discipline look like if its loving, but nto punishing?</u></i></br>
it looks kind, and necessary. it looks like a hairbrush.</br>
</br>
<i><u>what would it mean to be internally safe?</u></i></br>
2 be fully at peace, to be open 2 receive good things.</br>
</br>
<i><u>if my hormones are working (for which they very much are) what am i free to focus on instead?</u></i></br>
my future, my career in nursing, scratching the itch 2 help others that need my help. </br>
</br>
<i><u>what kind of partner/friend does my secure self attract?</u></i></br>
someone fun, someone unpretentious, someone patient, someone grounding, someone i could build a life with.</br>
</br>
<i><u>if i am trusted that i am becoming more myself everyday, by getting rid of the habits that are not me, </i><i>what would i stop fearing?</u> </i></br>
myself, and being uncomfortable, not getting things right away feels as if everything is slipping through my finger tips. maybe. </br>

i want my ankle on your ankle, as we sit across an outdoor table sharing oysters over ice. doesn’t that just sound so so nice. 12:55pm 02/17 </br> 
</br>
tits and ass after work i will dye my hair n go 2 9pm pilates. 12:41pm 02/17 </br>
</br>
i am genuinely so fucking bored and its not even 1. i just don’t like sitting here doing absolutely nothing. what frusterastes me sometimes is jason does everything himself. maybe its distrust for my employment, but i can’t help but want 2 feel useful. him being here is also making me limited in the my expression 2 move time. without jasons presence i can listen and watch without guilt. i was high earlier, but now its wearing off. which is very good. i want 2 be sober. i want 2 feel like a cold glass of water. 12:38pm 02/17 </br> 
</br>
i’m really not in a people mood, i don’t wanna sit behind this desk. i am being ungrateful. 
i am indeed very sad but i understand how needed the sadness mite be because it is the process of what has happened 2 me. maybe the trick is understanding not 2 wallow in pity. i wake up sad because i wake up without my mom. it feels inevitable, as it is something i have 2 learn 2 dress up and make room for. 11:28 02/17 </br>
</br>
sometimes i’m just like You Need To Shut The Fuck Up And Just Be. 11:25 02/17</br>
</br>
i said in the past that friends w benefits is a term used by men, but i have been late 2 find out that Alanis Moresset (spelled that wrong) has indeed invented the term. so it was a term coined by woman, used for men. i just have been feeling like shit over the casualness of sex. but maybe that’s more of my guilt. it just has me in disbelief that people actually go through life sexually with absolute no personalities. if someone views sex so casually, will that make them more inclined 2 cheat? reading this back, maybe the secret 2 casual sex is being disciplined? but sex overall isn’t something 2 b disaplined in. 11:12 02/17</br>
</br>
i’m annoyed as actual fuck like jason needs 2 leave i wanna b by myself and i honestly don’t know why im here if he is here it is absolutely dead and i just wanna go home and be with my dad. i keep hearing clipping and it fucking sounds like he’s clipping his nails. i honestly think it’s because my bag is in the back and it triggering me 2 think he’s going through all my shit. 11:07am 02/17 </br>
</br>
i hate being so reactive, i keep it internalized until i makeout with my journal. 10:52am 02/17</br>
</br>
to do today: work 10-6, watch movie with Papa, n inject my yummy medication. 10:51am 02/17</br>
</br>
i rescheduled my fucking labs and folx appointment and i’m declaring that it is indeed going 2 b 4 the last time. jason is here and he’s here because he wants 2 escape the family visiting him (get it) but it is slow as actual fuck. it’s tuesday. and tuesday is always like pulling teeth. i feel determined 2 drag myself through the hot coals on this period of my life. it almost feels cosmic. someone from my past had found me yesterday, and it has me wondering if then do we really get 2 escape the past? why do some people have the -what feels like sheer luck- ability 2 free themselves from that tether. taking the big ball 2 the grave. however, maybe they “pay 4 it” in the next life. i watched a video essay this morning that basically gave me the reassurance that i needed. it talked about the social pressures associated with being loved. this idea 4 women that there is this sense of a window of opportunity of being lovable. and also, being loveable isn’t this romanticized idea. love is going 2 be uncomfortable. love is looking and accepting the bad, even within yourself. it’s inevitable. it’s human. it’s beneficial. and in turn that frees me from the guilt of the past, as everything has it’s benefit, even if it was spoonfed through tabasco sauce. what else is on my mind? i still am waiting a week since my past email 2 email doctor in miami aka god. i want my vagaina terribly. therapy has given my the consciousness 2 understand that i can’t put all stock of my happiness in2 having a vagaina. i don’t even know if i have all the rite words 2 describe what it actually is that i am experiencing as maybe it is something 2 be communicated through experience. am i selfish 4 wanting a vagina? i ask myself why do i want a vagina? i want one. ive always wanted one. its my 4 year olds dream. i remember being 5 and cutting my penis with nail clippers. am i doing it 4 her? i recently got hit on by the most beautiful woman and i want 2 be with woman, but there is a deep part of me that only feels acceptable with woman if i had a vagaina. mainly because i hate my penis, so i can only imagine through another set of eyes. but then again, i could b making all of this up. i think maybe the reason i don’t feel accecptable is4 the reason that i would never be the girl 2 fuck, as i was born 2 be the woman who gets fucked. maybe the second i feel comfortable in my skin, god will show me someone who feels comfortable touching my skin. im not really internalizing any of this; but an acknowledgement of these passive thoughts this morning. 10:41am 02/16 </br>
