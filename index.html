  <a> i am indeed very sad but i understand how needed the sadness mite be because it is the process of what has happened 2 me. maybe the trick is understanding not 2 wallow in pity. i wake up sad because i wake up without my mom. it feels inevitable, as it is something i have 2 learn 2 dress up and make room for. 11:28 02/17 </br>
sometimes i’m just like You Need To Shut The Fuck Up And Just Be. 11:25 02/17</br>
i said in the past that friends w benefits is a term used by men, but i have been late 2 find out that Alanis Moresset (spelled that wrong) has indeed invented the term. so it was a term coined by woman, used for men. i just have been feeling like shit over the casualness of sex. but maybe that’s more of my guilt. it just has me in disbelief that people actually go through life sexually with absolute no personalities. if someone views sex so casually, will that make them more inclined 2 cheat? reading this back, maybe the secret 2 casual sex is being disciplined? but sex overall isn’t something 2 b disaplined in. 11:12 02/17</br>
i’m annoyed as actual fuck like jason needs 2 leave i wanna b by myself and i honestly don’t know why im here if he is here it is absolutely dead and i just wanna go home and be with my dad. i keep hearing clipping and it fucking sounds like he’s clipping his nails. i honestly think it’s because my bag is in the back and it triggering me 2 think he’s going through all my shit. 11:07am 02/17 </br>
i hate being so reactive, i keep it internalized until i makeout with my journal. 10:52 02/17</br>
to do today: work 10-6, watch movie with Papa, n inject my yummy medication. 10:51am 02/17</br>
i rescheduled my fucking labs and folx appointment and i’m declaring that it is indeed going 2 b 4 the last time. jason is here and he’s here because he wants 2 escape the family visiting him (get it) but it is slow as actual fuck. it’s tuesday. and tuesday is always like pulling teeth. i feel determined 2 drag myself through the hot coals on this period of my life. it almost feels cosmic. someone from my past had found me yesterday, and it has me wondering if then do we really get 2 escape the past? why do some people have the -what feels like sheer luck- ability 2 free themselves from that tether. taking the big ball 2 the grave. however, maybe they “pay 4 it” in the next life. i watched a video essay this morning that basically gave me the reassurance that i needed. it talked about the social pressures associated with being loved. this idea 4 women that there is this sense of a window of opportunity of being lovable. and also, being loveable isn’t this romanticized idea. love is going 2 be uncomfortable. love is looking and accepting the bad, even within yourself. it’s inevitable. it’s human. it’s beneficial. and in turn that frees me from the guilt of the past, as everything has it’s benefit, even if it was spoonfed through tabasco sauce. what else is on my mind? i still am waiting a week since my past email 2 email doctor in miami aka god. i want my vagaina terribly. therapy has given my the consciousness 2 understand that i can’t put all stock of my happiness in2 having a vagaina. i don’t even know if i have all the rite words 2 describe what it actually is that i am experiencing as maybe it is something 2 be communicated through experience. am i selfish 4 wanting a vagina? i ask myself why do i want a vagina? i want one. ive always wanted one. its my 4 year olds dream. i remember being 5 and cutting my penis with nail clippers. am i doing it 4 her? i recently got hit on by the most beautiful woman and i want 2 be with woman, but there is a deep part of me that only feels acceptable with woman if i had a vagaina. mainly because i hate my penis, so i can only imagine through another set of eyes. but then again, i could b making all of this up. i think maybe the reason i don’t feel accecptable is4 the reason that i would never be the girl 2 fuck, as i was born 2 be the woman who gets fucked. maybe the second i feel comfortable in my skin, god will show me someone who feels comfortable touching my skin. im not really internalizing any of this; but an acknowledgement of these passive thoughts this morning. 10:41 02/16 </br>
i realize that it is definitely because i am insecure and i need to get over myself. 11:05pm 02/16</br>
tonight i relapsed 10:35pm 02/16 </br>
i absolutely feel like killing myself. i feel like when i was talking about my one nite stand i was secretly talking about him as i wonder why my brain is telling me he thinks im a walking pile a shit a vile woman a unpure umpire a gross divider onto the fucking grace that once once was. blah blah blah blah 10:35pm 02/16 </br>
fuck all these men i reclaim all of my power back 2 me Eat My Shit 10:32pm 02/16 </br>
